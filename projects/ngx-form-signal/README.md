# NgxFormSignal

Signal based form api for angular.

The goal of NgxFormSignal is to allow easy conversion from existing form objects to reactive signal primitives. This gives developers the ability to derive state off an existing form object as well as react to form state changes such as dirty, invalid, touched, etc... while remaining in the signal realm.
